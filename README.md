# ecommerce

My goal is create a ecommerce using JEE that can be consumed by Web App, REST and SOAP.

So far I have used the following technologies:

- JAX-RS - Jersey
- JAX-WS
- OAuth 2 - Apache OAuth (Integration with Google for login in the webapp and Authentication server for my exposed APIs)
- Hibernate (I will migrate to JPA)
